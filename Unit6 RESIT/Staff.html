                  Helpful and Attentive: Ushers are responsible for guiding patrons to their seats, so they must be keenly aware of the theater layout and available seating.

                  Customer-Focused: They address any seating issues or concerns, often going above and beyond to ensure a pleasant viewing experience.
                  Energetic and Efficient: Handling high volumes of orders quickly, especially during peak times, requires a high level of energy and efficiency.
                  Personable: Concession workers often engage in brief interactions with many customers, making a friendly and upbeat attitude important.
                  Multitaskers: They juggle various tasks such as preparing food, handling payments, and maintaining cleanliness, often simultaneously.</p>
